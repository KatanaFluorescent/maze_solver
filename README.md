Welcome to this maze solver and editer project.

To launch the maze solver, run the java file entitled UITest.java.

A dialog box will show up with some help to understand how the application works. Click on OK to open the maze solver and start editing/solving mazes. Below is a copy of the help that will be displayed in the dialog box, with some additional information in case you need it.

* In grey, the walls, in white, the empty boxes, in blue the departure, in red the arrival and in yellow the path to arrival. 
* If a button is green, it means the option associated with it is enabled, if it is in red it means it is disabled.
* To create a new maze, use the spinners to choose the size (min size 1, max size 30) then click on create. A maze of the desired size, initialized with empty boxes, will then be created.
* To edit the maze, click on "type of box to add", use the drop down menu to choose the type of box, then click on "Enable edit" to activate edition mode, then all you have to do is to click on the boxes you want to change.
* Finally, click on display solution to see the solution. Be careful, you need to set up arrival an departure before trying to display solution (or else you will get an error)
* The buttons save maze to text file and load maze from text file are pretty self explanatory, and will get you an error if you try to load a maze with a text file that has an unrecognized format.

Happy maze editing and solving !
